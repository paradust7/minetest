 * Important:
 *
 * After createOpenXRConnector() succeeds, there are no failures at this layer.
 *
 * Methods of COpenXRConnector will continue to pretend to work, even if the OpenXR instance is
 * dead and failing to recreate.
 *
 * This is because the OpenXR specification allows clients to reconnect after the runtime comes
 * back online, even after crash/shutdown/update. Clients with another UI are able to keep
 * running.
 *
 * TODO: Pause the game in the event the system shuts off.
